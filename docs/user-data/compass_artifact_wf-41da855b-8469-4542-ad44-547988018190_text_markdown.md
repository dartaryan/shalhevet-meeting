# Shalhevet Vardi: Israel's rising AI education entrepreneur

**Shalhevet Vardi (שלהבת ורדי)** is an Israeli AI entrepreneur, educator, and content creator who founded Aimprove in 2022 to democratize artificial intelligence knowledge for Hebrew speakers. Through her popular podcast "AI לומדים" (Learning AI), professional courses, and corporate training programs, she has established herself as a leading voice in practical AI education in Israel. Her mission centers on making AI technology accessible to everyone—"no big words, no unnecessary theory, just practical application."

## From self-taught learner to AI education leader

Shalhevet Vardi's expertise in artificial intelligence comes not from formal academic credentials but from **self-directed learning** and hands-on experience. She has developed significant expertise in **CPMAI** (Cognitive Project Management for AI), which she now applies to help businesses and individuals navigate the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

Based in Israel's tech hub region (Tel Aviv-Jerusalem area), she launched Aimprove with a straightforward philosophy: teaching people to work with AI tools in practice—at work, in business, and in everyday life. Her approach prioritizes accessibility and practicality over theoretical complexity, making her content especially valuable for those new to AI technology.
